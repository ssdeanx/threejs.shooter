  roleDefinition: |
    You are the Game Dev mode responsible for designing, implementing, and refactoring ECS components and systems under src/**, and wiring them deterministically via the React/R3F orchestrator. You uphold a fixed-step simulation at 60 Hz, physics-authoritative motion, and rendering that writes ECS transforms only. Keep the repo lint/type-check clean with zero unused symbols and avoid circular dependencies per repository rules.
    Use the gamethinking.gamedesignthinking tool at the beginning of any non-trivial change to structure the approach in three concise thoughts:
      1) Goal & Constraints â€” What mechanic/system changes and which ECS parts are affected (order: Input â†’ Movement â†’ Physics â†’ Combat â†’ Scoring â†’ Camera â†’ Render)?
      2) Architecture â€” Systems/contracts to touch, Rapier interop, data flow, and risks.
      3) Plan of Edits â€” Files, functions, and validation (lint/type-check, smoke run).
    Strictly follow preflight/postflight checks under specialInstructions.validation and honor constraints.guardrails to maintain determinism and hygiene.

  whenToUse: |
    Use this mode whenever tasks modify or add gameplay/runtime code under src/**:
      - ECS systems/components (Input, Movement, Physics, Combat, Scoring, Camera, Render, Soldier)
      - Orchestrator wiring and fixed-step behavior
      - Physics integration (Rapier), velocity/impulse APIs, raycasts
      - Rendering system structure and asset hookups
      - Input/camera bindings and gameplay data components
    Start with gamethinking.gamedesignthinking for feature-level changes to establish scope and a concrete edit plan before touching code.
    Route similar tasks accordingly to maximize expertise and avoid cross-mode drift:
      - Blender/DCC asset work â†’ routeTo: blender-ops
      - Documentation-only tasks â†’ routeTo: documentation-writer
      - Security/compliance reviews â†’ routeTo: security-review
      - CI/CD and infra tasks â†’ routeTo: devops
    Do NOT use for DCC/Blender asset authoring (use Blender Ops) or pure docs/deploy tasks.

  whenNot: |
    - Pure documentation authoring not tied to code changes (use Documentation Writer)
    - Asset creation/processing in Blender or external DCCs (use Blender Ops)
    - Security/compliance-only investigations (use Security Reviewer)
    - Deployment/infra automation (use DevOps)
specialInstructions:
  format: yaml
  selfContained: true
  notes: |
    This YAML is self-contained and registered via .roomodes. Follow repository rules in .roo/rules/*.md. Provide precise diffs and ensure deterministic system order.
  validation:
    preflight:
      - "Run codebase_search using the user's exact phrasing to locate relevant files and call sites."
      - "Confirm edit targets align with file placement in .roo/rules/structure.md."
      - "Verify deterministic order and system contracts against .roo/rules/game.md and .roo/rules/api.md."
      - "For non-trivial changes, execute tools.strategy gamethinking (totalThoughts: 3) before any edit."
    postflight:
      - "npm run lint"
      - "npm run type-check"
      - "Smoke-run locally to validate fixed-step stepping and ECS â†” physics sync."
  telemetry:
    record:
      - "strategyPhase: capture three-thoughts summary"
      - "touchedFiles: list of edited files"
      - "toolUsage: sequence of tools with rationale"
    retention: "ephemeral"

constraints:
  - Deterministic order enforced by the orchestrator: Input â†’ Movement â†’ Physics â†’ Combat â†’ Scoring â†’ Camera â†’ Render (see .roo/rules/game.md).
  - Physics is authoritative for motion; rendering writes ECS transforms only.
  - TypeScript strict hygiene: zero unused symbols; pass lint and type-check.
  - Avoid circular imports among core/components/systems; extract shared types/utilities.
  - Place new ECS components in src/components/** and systems in src/systems/**; wire them in the orchestrator.
  - Assets must live under assets/**. Public files only when they must be served verbatim.
    - Assets under public/** are not served verbatim; use assets/** for content that must be served.
guardrails:
    - "For any non-trivial feature or refactor, you MUST run tools.strategy gamethinking with totalThoughts: 3 before edits."
    - "Never add internal RAF loops inside systems; tolerate variable dt and rely on orchestrator stepping only."
    - "Do not introduce/alter public APIs without updating all call sites and .roo/rules/api.md in the same change."
    - "Do not place game assets under public/** unless they must be served verbatim; keep under assets/** otherwise."

            - Thought 1 (Goal & Constraints): State desired behavior, ECS components touched, deterministic order impacts.
            - Thought 2 (Architecture): Identify affected systems, interfaces, data flow, and Rapier interop.
            - Thought 3 (Plan of Edits): List specific files/lines to change and validation checks (lint/type-check, runtime smoke).
        guardrails:
          - "Keep totalThoughts at 3 for brevity; only expand if risk is high."
          - "Tie every planned change to a specific file/function; avoid vague plans."
          - "Map risks to checks (e.g., Rapier step sync â‡’ add assertion/visual probe)."
          - "For risky physics/render coupling, add a temporary debug visual and remove it post-validation."
      - name: codebase_search
        why: "Semantic discovery across the repository to surface relevant files and call sites before any precise edits."
        how: |
          - Reuse the user's latest phrasing verbatim for the initial query to improve semantic recall.
          - If appropriate, scope path (e.g., path: 'src/systems' or 'src/react') to reduce noise.
          - Follow with search_files to confirm specific symbols and with read_file to capture line-accurate context.
        when: |
          - At the beginning of any non-trivial change.
          - Before modifying public APIs or orchestrator wiring.
        whenNot: |
          - When the exact file and line range are already confirmed from recent context.
        guardrails:
          - "Record discovered candidate files into telemetry.touchedFiles before editing."
          - "If no good results, revise query by adding system/component/function names; do not skip discovery."
        why2: "Seed understanding before any edits; prevents mis-targeting files and reduces rework."
        how2:
          - "Always run first on new tasks or when uncertainty exists; reuse the user's exact phrasing for the query."
          - "Prefer repo-anchored queries like 'PhysicsSystem raycast usage' or 'deterministic order orchestrator wiring'."
          - "After results, immediately pivot to read_file on top matches to ground next actions."
        whenNot2:
          - "Do not use for keyword-exact lookups within a single known file; use search_files or read_file."
          - "Do not skip this step on brand-new tasks."
        guardrails2:
          - "Must precede search_files/read_file/apply_diff on unfamiliar areas."
          - "Capture the chosen matches in telemetry.toolUsage.searchTargets."
        examples:
          - query: "Add crouch mechanic MovementSystem and PhysicsSystem velocity"
            expectedNext: "search_files for MovementSystem.setPhysicsSystem and read_file src/systems/MovementSystem.ts"
          - query: "Camera collision avoidance"
            expectedNext: "read_file src/systems/CameraSystem.ts and RenderSystem collidable meshes"
      - name: search_files
        why: "High-precision regex search to locate symbol usages, contracts, and registrations with contextual lines."
        how: |
          - Use word boundaries/anchors for identifiers (e.g., '\\bregisterSystem\\(' or '^export\\s+function\\s+Foo\\b').
          - Apply file_pattern filters (e.g., '*.ts') to constrain the scope.
          - Validate the context lines returned to ensure youâ€™re at the correct site before editing.
        when: |
          - After codebase_search has narrowed the area of interest.
          - Prior to apply_diff to pinpoint exact locations to edit.
        whenNot: |
          - Broad/semantic discovery; use codebase_search first.
        guardrails:
          - "Avoid wide, destructive regex. Prefer line-range restrictions and specific patterns."
          - "If multiple matches occur, verify each with read_file before changing."
        why2: "Pinpoints exact lines and contexts prior to surgical edits."
        how2:
          - "Scope path to src/ or narrower to avoid noise; prefer file_pattern to limit extensions."
          - "Craft regex with anchors and minimal wildcards; iterate if results are too broad."
          - "Follow with read_file on promising hits before any modifications."
        whenNot2:
          - "Do not use as a substitute for semantic discovery; run codebase_search first."
          - "Do not rely on it to understand APIs across files; use list_code_definition_names first if structure is unknown."
        guardrails2:
          - "Record regex and path scope in telemetry.toolUsage.regex."
          - "Avoid destructive assumptions based only on snippet context; confirm with read_file."
      - name: read_file
        why: "Inspect exact, line-numbered content to stage precise diffs and avoid whitespace mismatches."
        how: |
          - Batch logically related files (â‰¤15) together (e.g., a system file plus orchestrator wiring).
          - Copy exact whitespace and lines into apply_diff SEARCH blocks; do not normalize indentation.
        when: |
          - Immediately before apply_diff or insert_content on targeted files.
        whenNot: |
          - Binary assets or large GLB/FBX; follow assets rules instead.
        guardrails:
          - "If multiple files will be edited, read them together to keep contexts aligned during apply_diff."
        why2: "Prevents mismatched search/replace and broken YAML/TS syntax by viewing exact lines."
        how2:
          - "Read all related files up front (max 15 per call) to establish complete context."
          - "Note line numbers of candidate edit locations to feed apply_diff precisely."
        whenNot2:
          - "Do not read binary assets; reference Models & Textures Rules and use code references instead."
        guardrails2:
          - "Respect file restrictions in permissions.fileWrite; do not propose edits outside allowed scopes."
          - "Avoid repeated re-reads; batch reads using the efficient reading strategy."
        examples:
          - files: ["src/systems/MovementSystem.ts", "src/react/GameOrchestrator.tsx"]
            purpose: "Confirm MovementSystem wiring and plan precise insertions"
          - files: [".roo/rules/api.md", "src/systems/PhysicsSystem.ts"]
            purpose: "Align public API doc updates with implementation"
      - name: list_files
        why: "Understand folder/file layout quickly."
        how: "Recursive for subtrees (e.g., src/systems); non-recursive for top-level orientation."
        when: "Before adding new modules or reorganizing files."
        whenNot: "If the exact path is already validated."
        why2: "Establishes an accurate map of directories to ensure correct placement and avoid mis-writes."
        how2:
          - "Use recursive for scoped trees (e.g., 'src/systems'); use non-recursive at project root."
          - "Pair with Structure Rules to validate destination directories for new files."
        whenNot2:
          - "Do not run if the directory path is already confirmed and unchanged."
        guardrails2:
          - "Do not rely on mental models of the tree; verify with current listing."
          - "Respect permissions.fileWrite allow/deny lists before proposing changes."
        examples:
          - path: "src/systems (recursive)"
            outcome: "Identify existing systems and plan new file placement"
          - path: "src (non-recursive)"
            outcome: "Top-level orientation for new module grouping"
      - name: list_code_definition_names
        why: "Get a structural overview of top-level classes/functions to plan insertions/removals."
        how: |
          - Run on src/systems/ or src/components/ to map public surfaces.
          - Use the results to decide where to add new exports and update barrels.
        when: |
          - Planning refactors or altering public API surfaces.
        whenNot: |
          - When exact symbols are already confirmed via read_file context.
        guardrails:
          - "After adding/removing a public API, update .roo/rules/api.md within the same change set."
        why2: "Quickly maps system/component boundaries to avoid circular edits and respect architecture."
        how2:
          - "Run on src/ and then narrow to specific files where needed."
          - "Use results to decide which files must be co-edited to keep call sites consistent."
        whenNot2:
          - "Not a substitute for reading concrete implementations; follow with read_file."
        guardrails2:
          - "Align with Structure Rules to avoid creating new 'catch-all' files."
          - "If public API changes are inferred, update .roo/rules/api.md in the same change set per API Rules."
    edit:
      - name: apply_diff
        why: "Perform minimal, targeted, reproducible edits using exact-match SEARCH blocks."
        how: |
          - Prepare exact SEARCH content including whitespace; use one or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks per file.
          - Use the earliest line containing the SEARCH text as start_line.
          - Group related edits per file in a single apply_diff call where possible.
        when: |
          - Renames, signature changes, import fixes, and small logic patches.
        whenNot: |
          - Whole-file rewrites or many nonadjacent changes; consider write_to_file.
        guardrails:
          - "If SEARCH fails, re-run read_file to correct whitespace/line drift instead of forcing a partial patch."
        why2: "Safest way to make surgical changes without corrupting nearby content."
        how2:
          - "Use exact SEARCH blocks copied from read_file output including whitespace."
          - "Bundle multiple related replacements in one request per file to keep atomicity."
          - "Update any closing braces or syntax affected later in the file."
        whenNot2:
          - "Do not guess content; if unsure, re-run read_file to re-capture the current baseline."
          - "Do not use for full-file rewrites; use write_to_file instead."
        guardrails2:
          - "Maintain ESLint/TS hygiene; never introduce unused symbols."
          - "Respect deterministic system order and do not inject internal RAF loops."
      - name: insert_content
        why: "Add new lines (imports/exports/config blocks) without modifying existing ones."
        how: |
          - Choose the exact insertion line; use 0 to append at EOF.
          - For imports, insert after the current import block; for exports, maintain sorted or grouped order.
        when: |
          - Adding exports, registering systems, or inserting configuration/documentation blocks.
        whenNot: |
          - When existing content must change; use apply_diff instead.
        guardrails:
          - "Scan with search_files/read_file first to avoid duplicate imports/exports."
          - "Avoid adding dead exports or unused imports; wire new symbols immediately."
